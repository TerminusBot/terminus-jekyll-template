description: too，very，absolutely, too much, too many
---
- Too describes something negative or unwanted. Very makes the adjective stronger. The words not too with an adjective shows that there isn't a problem.
- We don't use very with strong adjectives.Use absolutely to make strong adjectives even stronger
- We use (not) enough with adjectives and nouns to talk about the right amount of something. (Not) enough comes after an adjective or before a noun
- We use too with much and many to talk about an amount or number of something that is more than we want or need. Too many goes with countable nouns. Too much goes with uncountable nouns.
## too and very

- The word **too** shows there is **a problem, or something bad**. Look at some more examples.

*Goldilocks sat in the first chair, but it was **too** big. (The problem is the size of the chair: it is big and Goldilocks is small, so she can't get comfortable.)*

*Goldilocks lay down in the first bed, but it was **too** hard. (This time, the problem is the softness of the bed. It's hard, so Goldilocks can't rest comfortably.)*

*I really like these boots, but they're **too** expensive. (The problem is the price of the boots: I can't afford to buy them.)*

*I was **too** busy to take a break, so I missed my TV programme. (I had a lot of work and this was a problem because I couldn't take a break and watch TV.)*

- The form is too + adjective.

too hot
too cold
too big  

- BE CAREFUL: If we say a sentence with too in the **negative form, then we mean it isn't a problem**. The form is **not + too + adjective**.

*I can eat this porridge - it's not **too hot** and it's not too cold.*

-----
- Very + adjective

*Goldilocks was **very** tired. Do you think this is just normal tiredness or something more? Well, the word very makes the adjective stronger.*
*Goldilocks was **very** tired so she went to sleep in the baby bear's bed.*

- The form is **very + adjective**. Here are some more examples.

*Papa bear was **very** angry because someone had slept in his bed.*
*I like your shoes - they're **very** nice!
That English test wasn't **very** difficult! Studying with BBC Learning English really helps!*

- BE CAREFUL: We **don't use very with strong adjectives**. Look here:

*Goldilocks was terrified! (The word terrified already means 'very scared', so we don't say 'very terrified'.)*
****
- **To make strong adjectives even stronger, use absolutely.**

*That was the worst play I have ever seen in my life - it was absolutely terrible!*

*I've been working day and night - I'm absolutely exhausted!*

- Other strong adjectives are: excellent, enormous, correct, incredible, dreadful, perfect.

*We hope that one day you will have absolutely excellent English!*

**Summary:too means there is some kind of problem and very makes adjectives stronger. You've also learnt about strong adjectives and absolutely.**

##  [enough, too much and too many](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-19/session-2/activity-2#navIndex-3)
- We use **enough and not enough with adjectives** in English to talk about the right amount of a **thing or a quality**.
*This computer is powerful enough for all your video editing needs. (The computer has the right amount of power to do all types of video editing.)*

- The form is **adjective + enough** in positive sentences or **not + adjective + enough** in negative sentences.


- Another way we use enough and not enough in English is with **nouns**, to say whether there is the right **amount of something**.
* There was enough porridge for Goldilocks to satisfy her appetite. (She ate it all and wasn't hungry after - it was the right amount.)*
- We use **too much and too many** in English to talk about an amount of something that **causes a problem** because it is more than we want or need.    
- We use **too many with countable nouns**, like rules and people. We use **too much with uncountable nouns**, like salt and chocolate.

## [intonation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/lower-intermediate/unit-27/session-2/activity-2)   
The way you make your voice go up and down when you speak is called intonation, and it's really important for questions. In English, questions that you can answer yes or no usually go up at the end - they have rising intonation. Questions that ask for certain information, with question words like when or where, tend to go down - they have falling intonation.

When we use question tags, our intonation can change the meaning and purpose of our question.

Firstly, we might be asking a question that we really don't know the answer to.( **up**)   
Secondly, we might be using a question tag to check something we think is true. (**down**)   
Thirdly, we might use a question tag to start a conversation.(**down**)   
Here is one question tag and three possible meanings depending on the intonation:   
You're our new designer, aren't you? (With the voice going up/rising intonation: this is a real question and the speaker doesn't know the answer.)

You're our new designer, aren't you? (With the voice going down/falling intonation: the speaker thinks they know the answer to the question and wants to check.)

You're our new designer, aren't you? (With the voice going down/falling intonation: the speaker is expressing interest and wants to start a conversation.)

So remember, when a person says a question tag and their voice goes up, they probably don't know the answer. If their voice goes down, they might just be checking what they think is true!

**Compound adjectives with hyphens**:
- adjective/adverb + present participle  
a hard-working student

- adjective/adverb + noun  
a last-minute decision

- noun + adjective  
a world-famous athlete

- adverb/noun + past participle before a noun  
well-respected politicians

- three-word compound adjectives before a noun  
out-of-date fashion

**Compound adjectives without hyphens**:
- adverb/noun + past participle after a noun  
the politicians were well respected

- three-word compound adjectives after a noun  
that voucher is out of date

**compound adjectives made with an adverb ending in –ly, both before and after a noun**  
a carefully written letter  
the letter was carefully written   
------------------------------------------------------------------   
**[Present simple](https://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/english/course/intermediate/unit-1/session-2)**  
We use the present simple for things that we do regularly and for facts, habits, truths and permanent situations. We often use time expressions like every day, once a week, on Fridays.

I check my email every day. (regular activity)     
Yuki works at the bank. (permanent situation)      
Form: For positive sentences, use the same form as the infinitive without 'to' for I, you, we and they. For he, she and it, add -s or -es to the infinitive. Make questions and negatives with do / does + the infintive without 'to'.

They live in Rome.  
Julian starts work at nine o’clock and finishes at five.
I don't eat meat.  
It doesn't usually snow in October.
Why do you read the news online every day?
Does the supermarket sell stamps?
Present Continuous
We use the present continuous for things that are happening at the time we are speaking, for temporary situations, and for activities that are in progress.

Just a minute. I’m checking my email. (now)  
She usually works in London, but she’s working from home this week. (temporary)   

I’m studying Economics (activity in progress)  

We can also use the present continuous for future arrangements, usually with a time expression.
I'm seeing the doctor on Monday morning.
Form:
For positive sentences, the form is subject + am/is/are + verb-ing. Make questions and negatives with am/are/is + not + verb-ing.

Can I call you back later? We’re having dinner right now.
He isn’t answering his mobile at the moment.
What are you doing?
Is it raining?
Note: There are some verbs that we don’t usually use in the continuous form. They are often verbs of thinking and feeling, for example: hear, see, smell, hate, know, understand, believe, want, need.

WRONG: Could you explain that again? I’m not understanding.
CORRECT: Could you explain that again? I don’t understand.

Present Perfect
Use the present perfect for:

1) Life experiences in the past. We don’t say when these happened: we are interested in the experience, not the time or date. We often use ever and never.

I’ve seen all Tarantino’s films.
Have you ever eaten sushi? - Yes, I have. / No, I haven’t.
2) Recent past actions that are important now.

Oh no! I’ve left my wallet on the bus.
The president has resigned.
3) Past situations that are still happening now. We often use how long with for (throughout a period of time) and since (from a point in the past until now).

I haven’t seen Jenny this morning. (It is still this morning.)
How long have you known Mitya? - I’ve known him for two years.
Jack's been in Italy since January.
4) With just, already, yet to talk about recent events in the past. The exact time is not important. Use just and already mainly in positive sentences. Use yet in negatives and questions.

It’s just stopped raining. Let’s go out.
Can you feed the cat? - I’ve already fed her.
We can still watch the film. It hasn’t started yet.
Have you done your English homework yet?
Note: Use the past simple for completed actions in the past.

I saw Jenny yesterday.  
Peter moved to Saudi Arabia in 2011.  
Natasha didn't want to have another piece of cake.  
When did you see Alex?
Form:
For positive sentences, the form is subject + have/has + past participle. Make negatives with not and change the word order to make questions.

I've finished the report.  
Jack's been in Italy since January.  
We've just got back from Germany.  
I haven’t seen Jenny this morning.  
How long has Alex known Mitya?

**Haggling in English**  

- 'Do' = sell

When we are haggling, instead of using the verb sell, we often use do. We use it with can/can't and could/couldn't:

I can probably do it for about £650.  
Can't you do it a bit cheaper?  
Could you do it for 500?  
You couldn't do it for £550?  
-  To 'knock off'

This phrasal verb means 'lower the price'.

Can you knock off another £30?
I could knock off £10 for you.
- When you've got a deal: 'Go on then'

To show that the price is agreed, it sounds very natural in spoken English for the buyer and/or the seller to say: Go on then.  

Buyer: £600?  
Seller: Go on then.  
Buyer: I'll give you £40 for it.  
Seller: Go on then.  
---------------------------------------------
- Time expressions with **at**

**specific times** - at one o’clock / at 2:30pm  
points of the day - at noon / at midday / at night / at midnight  
**points of the day when things happen** - at breakfast / at dinner / at lunchtime  
**festivals and special days** - at Easter, at Eid  
weekend - at the weekend  
- Time expressions with **on**  

**specific dates** - on 3rd May  
**specific days** - on Christmas Day / on New Year's Eve  
**days of the week** - on Monday / on Mondays  
- Time expressions with **in**  

**parts of the day** - in the morning / in the afternoon / in the evening
**seasons/month** - in spring / in summer / in autumn / in winter
**years** - in 1996  
- Tip 1 - On Saturday night
Look at this sentence. Should in, on or at go in the gap?

We're meeting __ Saturday night.
We would normally say on Saturday and at night. So should it be on – for Saturday – or at – for night? The answer is:

We're meeting on Saturday night.

We use the preposition on even though there is another time expression afterwards.  

- Tip 2 - On Christmas morning
Why do you think we use on in this sentence?

What did you do on Christmas morning?
Normally we use at for festivals like Christmas and we use in for parts of the day like the morning, but Christmas Day is actually a specific day, rather than a whole festival, so we use on. Again, we use the preposition on even though there is another time expression afterwards.

- Tip 3 - No preposition
Finally, in, at and on are not generally used before the words today, tomorrow and yesterday:

I can't go tomorrow
He wrote that article yesterday
We don't use in, on or at in time expressions with the words this, that, next, last, all, one, each, some and every:

I slept all day
He didn't come last night

## The present perfect continuous   
### Form  
**Subject + have/has/haven't/hasn't + been + present participle of main verb**  
*Positive*  
- Jack's working very hard for his exams. He's been revising all day.

*Negative*  
- I haven't been drinking coffee these last few days and my head is much clearer.

*Question*  
Present perfect continuous questions are made with:
**Have/has not + subject + been + present participle**

------------------------------------------------  2020.08.04  
Uncountable nouns have no plural form and are not used with the indefinite article a or an.

- Can you give me some information about accommodation in the city?

There are three main types of uncountable nouns that students often think are countable:

- activity nouns: travel, work, homework
- information nouns: advice, information, knowledge, research
- group nouns: accommodation, baggage, furniture, money, traffic, weather
Other nouns that are uncountable are:

- liquids and gasses: water, air
- materials and substances: wood, rice
- feelings and ideas: happiness, education
- subjects: geography, history, economics  

A few uncountable nouns look plural because they end in -s. But they use a singular verb like other uncountable nouns:
Physics is a very interesting subject.       

------------------------------------------------------
We prefer 'every' when we are thinking about the whole number in a group, and 'each' when we are thinking about the members of the group as individuals.  

-  Every room has a Wi-Fi connection. Each one has a different view.    

 To emphasise the individual members of a group, use 'every', not 'each'.   
 - I was too late to apply for accommodation. Every room in the building is already taken.  

 For only two things, we can use 'each' but not 'every'.  
 - The university has two student dormitories, with about 1,000 students in each building.   

 'Information' is an uncountable noun. 'Every' must be followed by a singular, countable noun.  
 -  All the information about accommodation is on our website.      

'Every' and 'each' must be followed by a singular noun. They can't be followed by a plural noun like 'students'.  
- Every student has their own room.  
- Each student has their own room.  

1) **All** or **All the** is followed by a plural or uncountable noun. **Every** and **each** are followed by a singular noun.

- All the students have their own rooms.
- All the information about accommodation is on our website.
- Every student has their own room.
- Each student has their own room.
2)  **Every** and **each** can often be used in the same place, but we prefer **every** when we are thinking about the whole number in a group, and **each** when we are thinking about the members of the group as individuals.

- Every room has Wi-Fi. Each one has a different view.
3) To emphasise the individual members of a group, use **every** not each.

- I was too late to apply for accommodation. Every room in the building is already taken.
4) For only two things, we can use **each** but not every.

- The university has two student dormitories, with about 1,000 students in each building.
5) **All** and **each** but not every can be followed by **of + a plural noun or pronoun**. Notice that **each of** with a plural noun or pronoun is followed by a singular verb.

- All of the students have a phone in the room.
- Each of them has a phone in their room.    

**both, either, and neither with nouns**
1) We use **both (of)**, **neither (of)** and **either (of)** to talk about two people or things. **Both** means this one AND the other one. **Neither** means NOT this one AND NOT the other one. **Either** means this one OR the other one. **Either** is used mainly in questions and negative sentences.

- Both of the men are wearing black ties.
- Both men are reading newspapers.
- Neither man is wearing a pink t-shirt.
- Neither of the men has blond hair.
- I don't think either man is going to get the job.
- She didn't choose either of them for the job.
2) We often use these patterns: **both… and...**,**neither… nor...**, and **either… or...**

- He plays both the violin and the guitar.
- Neither me nor my brother are married.
- Should I wear either this shirt or that one?
